# 🛍️ Customer Shopping Trends Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Analyzed shopping data using SQL to help a retail store decide what to stock and when, based on customer behavior, seasonality, and location trends.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Retailers face issues like overstocking, understocking, and poor location targeting. The goal is to optimize inventory planning using data insights.

## 🔍 Methodology
- Used SQL to analyze 3,900+ customer records
- Explored demographics, seasonal demand, store ratings, and repeat purchases
- Segmented results by gender, season, and location

## 📊 Key Insights
- 68% of customers are male → Stock more male-preferred items
- Seasonal trends differ → e.g., Jackets in Fall, Sunglasses in Winter
- Montana’s item preference differs from national trends → Location-specific stocking needed
- Texas & Wisconsin have highest review ratings → Replicate best practices
- Customers with 10+ purchases spend more → Target with loyalty programs
